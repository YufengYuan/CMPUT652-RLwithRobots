\BOOKMARK [2][]{subsection.1.1}{Consider a finite MDP, where a state is represented by a d-dimensional feature vector x\(s\), and the feature vectors for all N states form a Nd feature matrix X with rank d. The Mean Squared Value Error \(MSVE\) objective is "026B30D v- Xw"026B30D 2D, where v is an N-dimensional vector, [v]s = v\(s\) is the value of state s induced by policy , and D is a NN diagonal matrix with the steady-state probabilities d\(s\) induced by \040along the diagonal. Show that the solution to this objective is w*VE = \(AVE\)-1 bVE, where AVE = XDX and bVE = XDv \(15 points\). }{section.1}% 2
\BOOKMARK [2][]{subsection.1.2}{Consider a vector y that may not be in the linear span of the features, that is, y=Xw for any wRd. The projection matrix \040is such that y= Xwy , where wy = argminw "026B30D y- Xw"026B30D 2D, that is, it is the matrix that linearly transforms or ``projects'' y to the span of features according to norm "026B30D "026B30D 2D. Here D is a diagonal matrix with positive diagonal elements. Show that = X\(XDX\)-1XD, X=X and XD=XD \(15 points\). }{section.1}% 3
